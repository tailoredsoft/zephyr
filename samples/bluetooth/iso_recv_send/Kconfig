config BT_ISO_BIS_RECV_SEND
	bool "Enable Send/Recv in a BIS for group talk"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables code in the underlying stack to send and receive
	  audio in a BIS for group talk. This is only needed if the application
	  is using the group talk feature. The default is to not include this
	  code in the stack, which saves some code space.
	  If enabled, then the following MUST also be enabled in either file
	  prj.conf or overlay-bt_ll_sw_split.conf:
          CONFIG_BT_CTLR_SYNC_ISO=y
          CONFIG_BT_CTLR_ADV_ISO=y


config BT_ISO_BIS_RECV_SEND_DBG
	bool "Enable Send/Recv related debug code and attributes"
	default n
	help
	  Use this attribute to enable disable debug code and attributes
	  related to the Send/Recv feature. This is only needed if the
	  application is using the group talk feature. The default is to
	  not include this code in the stack, which saves some code space.

config BT_ISO_FUNC_NO_OPTIMIZE_MASK
	hex "Bitmask for enable/disable -O0 optimisation for functions"
	default 0x00000000
	help
	  Default will leave all functions optimised as per default.
	   Do a search to finf which bitmask controls which function.

config ISO_PRINT_INTERVAL
	int "Interval between each packet report"
	range 1 360000
	default 1
	help
	  Only print the packet report once in a given interval of ISO packets.

config ISO_ALIGN_PRINT_INTERVALS
	bool "Align report interval with incoming packets"
	help
	  Align interval-counter with packet number from incoming ISO packets.
	  This may be needed if report printouts are to be synchronized between
	  the iso_broadcast sample and the iso_receive sample.

config ISO_BLINK_LED0
	bool "Blink led0"
	depends on $(dt_alias_enabled,led0)
	select GPIO
	default y

config APP_FEATURES_BITMASK
	hex "Bitmask for application features"
	default 0x00000000
	help
	  Default will generate normal expected behavior.
	   0x00000001 - Only print ext & pa adv packets when PA not synced
	   0x00000002 - Print BIS data in new enhanced report format
